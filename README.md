I included a sample audio file, but you should put the song of your choice in the folder and change line 53 of cubes.pde to match the name.

Some values to play around with:
 - specLow, specMid and specHi: These values define the ranges of frequencies that will be assigned to each color. 
 - scoreDecreaseRate: Makes the cubes and environnement light out slower if the value is smaller.
 - nbMurs: The number of lines to show on the walls.
