# ProcessingCubes

I included a sample audio file, but you should put the song of your choice in the data folder and rename it "song.mp3", or change line 47 of cubes.pde to match the name.

Some vars to tweak with:
 - specLow, specMid and specHi: These values define the ranges of frequencies that will be assigned to each color. 
 - scoreDecreaseRate: Makes the cubes and environnement light out slower if the value is smaller.
 - nbMurs: The number of lines to show on the walls.
 
 I don't intend to add anything else to this program, this is only for sharing (and forking) purposes.
